# GameStore wep app

## Introduction

This is a simple web app using Asp.Net core, entity framework and sqlite with razor pages for the front end.

The goal for this project was:
- Getting to know Asp.Net core changes, updates and basics since last time I've used it
- Getting to know usage of entity framework core
- Understanding Razor pages and similarities to other frameworks I've used like svelte and sveltekit

## Thanks
